* 0.11.0
** Non-BC fixes
- =?split_trace_at=, =?splitl_trace= and =?splitr_trace= macros now use inverse matching.
  It was the original intention, but the fix is non-BWC

* 0.10.1
** Features
- =snabbkaffe.hrl= has been split into parts related to tracing and
  running the tests
* 0.10.0
** Breaking changes
- =snabbkaffe:strictly_increasing= function returns false when the
  list is empty

** Features
- Add =?tp_span= macro that wraps around a piece of code and emits
  trance events when entering and completing it

** Fixes
- Fix type specs

* 0.9.1
** Features
- Any term can be used as metric name
- snabbkaffe:push_stat work on remote nodes

** Fixes
- Don't filter out metrics that have less than 5 samples

* 0.9.0
** Breaking changes
- Tracepoints without severity no longer appear in the release build
  as debug logs. Old behavior can be emulated by explicitly specifying
  debug severity using =?tp(debug, Kind, Data)= macro
- Timestamp field (=tp=) has been moved to the metadata and renamed to
  =time=. Its resolution has been changed to microsecond.

** Features
- Add =logger= process metadata to the trace events
- Add =?of_domain= and =?of_node= macros
- Severity level of tracepoints affects severity of logs in the debug mode

* 0.8.2

** Fixes

* 0.8.1
** Breaking changes
- Change return type of =?causality= and =?strict_causality= macros to boolean

- Introduce support for distributed tracing. =snabbkaffe:forward_trace/1= function.

** Fixes
- Remove dependency on =bear=

* 0.7.0
** Breaking changes
- Drop support for OTP releases below 21
- Drop =hut= dependency, now in the release profile snabbkaffe always uses =kernel= logger

** Features
- Kind of the trace point now can be a string
- Concuerror support

** Fixes
- =?projection_complete= and =?projection_is_subset= macros now support multiple fields
- Allow usage of guards in the match patterns in all macros
